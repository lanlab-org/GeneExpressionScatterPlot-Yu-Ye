Test title: test case for requirement 1

Test for: RQ01

Description: The user can choose the corresponding file to upload to the web page, and the back-end code will make use of the correct information to realize the synthesis of the attribute set, and the completed set will be scattered according to the plane cartesian coordinate system of the two genes.

Rationale: As the core function of the software, this function mainly provides a data visualization way for users, so that users can quickly scatter the required data.

Input:
g1.json:S5000-g1.json
g2.json:S5000-g2.json
info.json:S5000-info.json

Expected output: The file can be uploaded, the page can be displayed, the small data file response time does not exceed 1 seconds.

Actual output:After clicking submit, the display time is less than 1 seconds.
