Test title: test case for requirement 1

Test for: RQ01

Description: The user can choose the corresponding file to upload to the web page, and the back-end code will make use of the correct information to realize the synthesis of the attribute set, and the completed set will be scattered according to the plane cartesian coordinate system of the two genes.

Rationale: As the core function of the software, this function mainly provides a data visualization way for users, so that users can quickly scatter the required data.

Input:

Expected output: The file can be uploaded, the page can be displayed, the small data file response time does not exceed 2 seconds.

Actual output:

@T002

Test title: test case for requirement 2

Test for: RQ02

Description: After the user obtains the corresponding scatter graph, the function distinguishes the collection of points of different attributes with different colors.

Rationale: The set of points for all the data is rendered in color based on the details.

Input:

Expected output: Different sets of points have different colors, and the colors do not repeat. There also need to be different colors at the bottom of the image for different attributes.

@T003

Test title: test case for requirement 3

Test for: RQ03

Description: You can select the properties you want to display based on user intent.

Rationale: For a particular property, the corresponding set of points can be hidden and displayed after clicking the color before the property. In turn, data can be filtered and rendered.

Input:

Expected output: After the completion of data loading, all the attribute sets and their colors will be displayed at the bottom. After selecting the corresponding target, click to achieve the rendering and hiding of the attribute.

@T004 

Test title: test case for requirement 4

Test for: RQ04

Description: The correlation coefficient calculation function for all attributes needs to be implemented.

Rationale: In the process of data processing, researchers have a certain need to calculate the relationship between the influence of two genes of a certain attribute value, so the calculation function of correlation coefficient is added.

Input:

Expected output: After the page loads, a table is rendered at the bottom of the scatter diagram, with the property name, the property valid point, the property correlation coefficient, and the p-value in each row of the table.

Actual output:
